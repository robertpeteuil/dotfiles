# Tokyo-night for [Eza](https://github.com/eza-community/eza)

## About

A Tokyo-night theme for `eza`, a modern replacement for `ls`.

## Usage

1. Copy to `~/.config/eza/theme.yml`

Note: on MacOS, `eza` will look for the theme file in `~/Library/Application Support/eza` by default. That directory can be overridden by setting `EZA_CONFIG_DIR`.
